# Open Exploration Project (Due 12/11)
_This is the final open-ended and self-directed in this course. Make something great!_

## Description
Work with the materials we've been developing thus far to make something small with UE5 inspired by your own interests as artists and designers. 

You're welcome to explore some things we still plan to cover in the final weeks of the semester (animation, particles, etc.), but make sure that it plays a secondary role (otherwise you may find yourself in over your head!)

#### You are not required to make a game.
You can include as much interaction as you find appropriate to your skill level but you do not need to create a "game". As an alternative,you might elect to make a small immersive environment that a player can explore with minimal interaction.

### Collaboration
You are allowed to collaborate with other people in this class if you'd like (maximum of 3 per team), as long as everyone has a role working with Unreal Engine.

For example, no one should have a role which is _just_ 3D modeling, but someone doing 3D modeling who is also helping build Materials in Unreal would be okay. 

#### Version Control
If you already have experience with git and would like a Version Control demo, let me know!

### Grading
Grading will be based on your ability toâ€¦
- Demonstrate an engagement with relevant concepts from the course. (33%)
- Address the technical or conceptual constraints of the project. (33%)
- Meet all delivery deadlines, from planning to playtesting, for the project. (33%)
