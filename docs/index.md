## Unreal Engine Workshop (GMD 265.01)

### About
This is the class site for Unreal Engine Workshop, taught at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Fall 2024.

### Course Description
In this introductory skill-building course, students will learn the fundamentals of Unreal Engine 5, a popular real-time 3D creation tool used in the production of AAA video games, real-time animation, immersive interactive art, architectural visualizations, & film.

Over the course of the semester, students will develop a foundation in the Unreal Editor’s workflow & toolset, learn to create basic interactivity/gameplay using UE5’s visual scripting tool (Blueprints), & gain experience integrating UE5 with 3D modeling software like Blender/Maya or asset libraries such as Quixel Megascans. All majors are welcome to enroll (Sophomore & above). Students are encouraged approach this powerful tool from the perspective of their own creative practice, using the workflow and techniques they learn throughout the semester to create independent & collaborative projects inspired by their own interests.

No prior programming or game design experience required.
