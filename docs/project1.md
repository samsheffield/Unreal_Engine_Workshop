# Open Exploration Project (Due 10/21)

## Description
For this 3(-ish) week assignment, you will create a small project with Unreal Engine directed by your own interests as artists and designers using the concepts and techniques we've been exploring this semester. This can be based on something you've already worked on in this class or something entirely new. 

### Project Expectations
__1. You will need to keep the scope of the project very small.__ 
The development period is roughly three weeks (one class meeting is interrupted by  Fall Break). This is not enough time to complete a large, highly polished project full of a bunch of things we haven't covered yet. 

An interesting, refined prototype/study/exploration with "beautiful corners" is _perfect_. 

__2. You are not expected to make a fully functional game.__ If you are interested in making something game-like, aim for something like a small, interesting, interactive environment that a player can explore. Rely on the First and Third Person Character Controller Bluprints for core mechanics instead of inventing somethingmore novel at this point.

__3. You're welcome to explore things we haven't covered.__ To minimize risk, make sure that it either plays a minor role or is well-documented online*. Otherwise, you may quickly find yourself in way over your head and without support!

__4. You are expected to plan, research, and document your work.__ This includes completing a preliminary planning document, gathering reference materials, sketching level layouts, and greyboxing/prototyping. Most of this will happen outside of the Unreal editor. 

Additionally, you will be expected to cite any assets that you use which you did not create in a text document which accompanies your project.

__5. Collaboration__
You are welcome to collaborate with another person in this class (maximum of 2 per team) as long as everyone has a role working with Unreal Engine**. Team members will be expected to complete a self/peer review evaluation form which may impact individual grades for the work.

---
(* _A completed online tutorial is not acceptable as a project for this class. You may use this kind of online resource to assist you, but the tutorial's outcome cannot be submitted as the entire project._)

(** _For example, no one should have a role which is "just" 3D modeling, but someone doing 3D modeling who is also helping build Materials and making sure they import to UE5 as expected would be okay._) 

### Deliverables and Schedule
__10/07__: 
- Initial project planning due, reference gathering in-progress, greyboxing and  protoyping.
- _Half of this class period will be a work session._
- Deliverable: Preliminary planning document, documentation of sketches and reference gathering, 3 screenshots of initial prototyping and/or greyboxing in Unreal.

__10/14__: 
- *Fall Break*

__10/21__: 
- Projects due for final in-class reviews, starting at 5pm
- Deliverables: Unreal Project, 3 high quality screenshots

### Grading
Grading will be based on your ability toâ€¦
- Demonstrate an engagement with relevant concepts from the course. (33%)
- Address the technical or conceptual constraints of the project. (33%)
- Meet all delivery deadlines for the project. (33%)
