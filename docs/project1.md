# Open Exploration Project (Due 10/23)
_You will have two bigger projects which are open-ended and self-directed in this course. Here's the first one. Make something great!_

## Description
Work with the materials we've been developing thus far to make something small with UE5 inspired by your own interests as artists and designers. 

You're welcome to explore some things we haven't covered yet, but make sure that it plays a minor role (otherwise you may find yourself in over your head!)

__You are not expected to make a fully functional game.__ Set your sights on something like a small immersive environment that a player can explore with minimal to no significant interaction.

### Collaboration
You are allowed to collaborate with other people in this class if you'd like (maximum of 3 per team), as long as everyone has a role working with Unreal Engine.

For example, no one should have a role which is _just_ 3D modeling, but someone doing 3D modeling who is also helping build Materials in Unreal would be okay.

__10/02__: 
- Initial project planning due, reference gathering in-progress
