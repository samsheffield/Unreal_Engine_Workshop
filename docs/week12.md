# Brief Introduction to Landscape Tools

## Reminder: External Hard Drive
I have two external hard drives that you can use to submit classwork each week if you are struggling with online storage caps. Please keep things organized.


## Today:
- No class this morning
- Review homework
- Brief introduction to the Landscape Tools (1/2)

## Review Homework
Please set up your homework on your computers and find at least 3 other people to share with. I'll be making the rounds as well.


## Landscape Tools (1/2)
The Landscape system inside of Unreal Engine is a collection of tools that allow you to create expansive outdoor environments.

Unreal's Documentation on the Landscape Editing Mode can be found [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/editing-landscapes-in-unreal-engine/)

### How to access the tools
The Layout Mode tools can be accessed from the Modes dropdown menu in the Toolbar.

### Landscape Editor's Modes
There are three modes to the Landscape tools:
- Manage: Used to create new landscapes and modify the components of existing landscapes.
- Sculpt: Used to shape the landscape by manipulating the height of the terrain in different ways
- Paint: Used to apply weighted landscape materials to the terrain

### Demo Goals
Due to our abbreviated class, we will split our demo into two parts over the next two weeks. This week we'll focus on:
- Creating new Landscapes
- Introduction to key tools used for sculpting landscape
- Working with Landscape Brushes
- Introduction to the landscape painting process
- Creating landscape materials
- Creating "auto" landscape materials

### Next week
Next week, we'll cover some more advanced topics such as:
- Working with splines
- Creating holes in landscape
- Adding grass and foliage
- Unreal Marketplace and Quixel Bridge

## Open Exploration Project 2 (Due 12/11)
The project description can be found [here](project2.md)

# Homework

### Landscape Exploration
For this assignment, you will be creating a small level with the landscape tools that leads a player to a destination using either a first or third person character controller. You will add foliage and a spline-based path to this level next week in class.

#### Two levels
This project should begin at a start screen and then switch to a game level by pressing a key or button. The main game level needs to be quittable or restart to the start level somehow (keypress, for example).

In the start level:
- Some text that onboards a player
- A button or text prompt which instructs players to start.

In the game level:
- Create an environment using the landscape tools. Use light, color, shape, or spatialized sound to encourage players towards their destination.
- Ability to quit or restart the game.


#### Important: What to turn in, where, and when
You can either upload the work to your class Drive folder (preferred) or transfer it to my external drive next week.

#### Zip your files before uploading
Please zip your Unreal project folder and name it `yourname_week12_uew.zip` before uploading it. Otherwise, the files may become corrupted in the process.

## Begin thinking about Open Exploration Project 2
1. Find people to work with if you want to collaborate.
2. Determine what you might want to make with the skill sets you currently have and the remaining things we will cover over the next 3 weeks.
