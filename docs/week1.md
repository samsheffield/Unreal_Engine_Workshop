# W E L C O M E ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class and set expectations (Syllabus review)
- Join the MGL Discord Server
- Plan for our next meeting

## This semester...
- We're going to have fun exploring an exciting new tool together and sharing our steps and misteps with each other.
- We're going to develop strategies for creating 3D interactive environments.
- We're going to focus on creating a foundation of technical knowledge that you can continue to grow with as _knowledgeable Unreal Engine beginners_!


## Before you leave
1. Join the MGL Discord (if you aren't already there). 
    - [Here's the invitation link](https://discord.gg/hpGgwpX8sQ).
    - You will need to visit the #welcome-and-rules channel to view the code of conduct and click the star emote to unlock the rest of the server.
    - Make sure your server nickname is representative of your name in this class (and presumably outside of this class!) 
    - Here's a link if you don't know how: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames
2. Head to the #unreal-workshop-f23 channel in the Fall 23 Classes category and say _hello!_ so I can assign you a role.
    - I'll be switching it to a private channel after we're all checked in.
    - If you forgot to set your nickname, you'll get a message back from me asking you to do so right away.
3. Make sure to talk with me about any questions you might have heading into the semester
    - In particular, let me know if you have any questions regarding hardware or software



# Homework

## Install software and create a blank project
- Install Epic Games Launcher and set up an account
- Use The Epic Games Launcher to install Unreal Engine 5.2 ([see this doc for details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYoJRtPhjKZxIdyCjXx-DEYitZrElA_1h4FRORijHoo/edit?usp=sharing))
- Do this on each computer you intend to use for classwork

## After you've created a Blank project
- Take a screenshot of UE5 displaying your blank project and post it to our class Discord channel
- Congrats! Give yourself a pat on the back.

## 3D Self-Study Task
Labor Day is great, but missing a week of class so early in the semester is not. 

Over the next week, I would like you to take advantage of this time gap to brush up on, or get acquainted with, the 3D modeling software of your choice (probably Blender or Maya, but use what you like as long as it works for you and can export geometry as FBX files). 

You don't need to be an expert at 3D modeling to succeed in this class, but it will certainly give you more expressive options when prototyping.

- If you're new-ish to 3D modeling...
Consider doing a short tutorial series focusing on modeling, basic texturing and shading, and exporting. Don't worry about rigging, or animating, or even rendering. 

- If you're not new to 3D modeling...
Make something for fun! Make sure you know how to export to FBX. Keep the poly count low.

### LinkedIn Learning
Youtube is fine and all, but did you know as students you also have access to LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com)? Just log in with your MICA username [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).

### Important: What to turn in, where, and when
- There is only one technical constraint: One dimension (x, y, or z) must be some multiple of a meter (one meter, two meters, three meters, etc.) This will be a valuable skill later.
- Take a screenshot of your 3D object in the 3D modeling software's editor window and post it to the class Discord channel.
- This is due by the start of class when we meet again in two weeks.

# Upcoming Events

## This Friday: Game Night at the MICA Game Lab! 6-9 PM
Let's kick off the new school year with a game night hosted by the MICA Game Lab! Join us for a night of good games,good  snacks, and good times. Check out our lab's impressive collection of tabletop and multiplayer video games, or bring your own favorites to play with new and old friends. 

All students are welcome, so invite your friends!

## Next Monday (09/04) 12-6:30 pm: Labor Day Game Jam.

MICA Start is hosting a small game jam for all students in the Game Lab (D220) on Labor Day. Sounds like a great opportunity to meet some new people, learn about MICA Start, and shake off some of that summertime rust from your Unity skills. 

Or maybe make a card game? Or a game about whispering outside? How about an "actually fun" ice breaker that we can use in classes? No experience needed. 

Help spread the word!
