# W E L C O M E ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class and set expectations (Syllabus review)
- Tour Unreal Engine 5.4
- Plan for our next meeting

## This semester...
- We're going to have fun exploring an exciting new tool together and sharing our steps and missteps with each other.
- We're going to develop strategies for creating 3D interactive environments.
- We're going to focus on creating a foundation of technical knowledge that you can continue to grow with as _knowledgeable Unreal Engine beginners_!

## Getting to know Unreal Engine 5.4
We'll spend some time this evening getting to know the UE5 editor and general workflow.

## Before you leave
1. Create a folder for work submissions in the class drive (on one of the Picasso drives from This PC) named *Lastname_Firstname_GMD265*.
2. Join the MGL Discord (if you aren't already there). 
    - [Here's the invitation link](https://discord.gg/hpGgwpX8sQ).
    - You will need to visit the #welcome-and-rules channel to view the code of conduct and click the star emote to unlock the rest of the server.
    - Make sure your server nickname is representative of your name in this class (and presumably outside of this class!) 
    - Here's a link if you don't know how: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames
2. Make sure to talk with me about any questions you might have heading into the semester
    - In particular, let me know if you have any questions regarding hardware or software



# Homework

## Install software and create a blank project
- Install Epic Games Launcher and set up an account
- Use The Epic Games Launcher to install Unreal Engine 5.2 ([see this doc for details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bYoJRtPhjKZxIdyCjXx-DEYitZrElA_1h4FRORijHoo/edit?usp=sharing))
- Do this on each computer you intend to use for classwork

## After you've created a Blank project
- Take a screenshot of UE5 displaying your blank project and post it to our class Discord channel
- Congrats! Give yourself a pat on the back.

## 3D Self-Study Task
Labor Day is great, but missing a week of class so early in the semester is not. 

Over the next week, I would like you to take advantage of this time gap to brush up on, or get acquainted with, the 3D modeling software of your choice (probably Blender or Maya, but use what you like as long as it works for you and can export geometry as FBX files). 

You don't need to be an expert at 3D modeling to succeed in this class, but it will certainly give you more expressive options when prototyping.

- If you're new-ish to 3D modeling...
Consider doing a short tutorial series focusing on modeling, basic texturing and shading, and exporting. Don't worry about rigging, or animating, or even rendering. 

- If you're not new to 3D modeling...
Make something for fun! Make sure you know how to export to FBX. Keep the poly count low.

- There is only one technical constraint: One dimension (x, y, or z) must be some multiple of a meter (one meter, two meters, three meters, etc.) *Hint: this will be a valuable skill later.*

- When done, export it as an FBX file.

### LinkedIn Learning
YouTube is fine and all, but did you know as students you also have access to LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com)? Just log in with your MICA username [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).

### Important: What to turn in, where, and when
- Take a screenshot of your 3D object and submit both it and the FBX file to your folder in the class drive.  (Please create a *Lastname_Firstname_Week1* assignment folder).
- This is due by the start of class when we meet again in two weeks.
