# Retargeting Skeletal Mesh Animation

## Reminder: External Hard Drive
I have two external hard drives that you can use to submit classwork each week if you are struggling with online storage caps. Please keep things organized.


## Today:
- Work session
- Skeletal Mesh Animation Introduction (2/2)

## Work Session
During the first half of class, you will have time to work on your final project. I will be reviewing project progress with each of you and answering any questions you might have.

## Skeletal Animation Introduction (2/2)

### Demo Goals
This week we'll focus on:
- Use the Starter Content mannequin's animation on an imported skeletal mesh
- Creating and retargeting IK rigs for skeletal meshes
- Retargeting animation blueprints

### Animation Retargeting 
Animation Retargeting is a feature that allows animations to be reused between characters that use the same Skeleton asset but may have vastly different proportions.

### Inverse Kinematics (IK)
Inverse Kinematics (IK) provide a way to handle joint rotation from the location of an end-effector rather than via direct joint rotation. It is used as a technique to efficiently create realistic movement for skeletal meshes.

### Note about Mixamo models
Mixamo models have a slightly different bone hierarchy which can be retargeted to the Starter Content skeleton. However, it is missing a critical root bone which needs to be created using Blender or Maya. There is an effective plugin for Blender which will add the root bone and rename the bones to be easier to work with in UE5 that is available [here](https://github.com/enziop/mixamo_converter)*.

_*Note: Sometimes using this tool will mess up your textures. _

# Homework

## Complete Open Exploration Project 2 (Due 12/11)
The project description can be found [here](project2.md)

### Important: What to turn in, where, and when

For this assignment, you will turn in:
- Completed Unreal project
- Optional: Packaged version playable on PC or Mac

If you have space in your online Drive, add it to the folder you've created. Otherwise, transfer it to the external hard drive sometime during our next class.
